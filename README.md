# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a space on a 3x3 grid. One player uses “X” and the other uses “O”. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If the grid is filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
